# God Protocol

### A data mediator

## Installation

```
npm install godprotocol --save
```

### Brief Description

This package is developing a framework for the Web 4.0
It is to help provide multiple compute instances for servers and also data flexibility and transactions.

You can get overall comprehension in just 4 method calls.

## Create an Account

Accounts comes with their own VM, thereby providing concurrency on processes being executed.

```js
import start from "godprotocol";

// Create an initial account
let initiator = start(`name`, { private: true || false });
// if private is set to `true`, communication to the account instance must be validated by sigining with the private key.
// N.B your keypairs are generated offline.
```

| `Parameters` | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | string         | Account names can be any valid variable string. Such as a Public Key                                                                        |
| `private`    | object:boolean | default `false`, if set to true, then any payloads sent to the account must be signed using the private key belonging to the account `name` |

## Load Instructions

The load method is the second in the pipeline,
It is used to set your programs into the network web,
where its data can continue to be accessed, and subsequent
calls can be made on the loaded program.

### Usage

```js
initiator.load(
  {
    instructions: ["link Account/initiator/Datatypes/Number", "write 7", "pop"],
    account: `public_key`,
  },
  cb
);
```

Type `method`

| `Parameters` | Type     | Destructure    | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `program`    | object   | `instructions` | An array of opcode-operands generated by the [`Loader Sequence`](https://godprotocol-web.vercel.app/loader_sequence) |
|              |          | `account`      | Account instance to load and execute the program in.                                                                 |
| `cb`         | function |                | A function that is called with the blocks mined during the execution.                                                |

## Run Program

The run is technically the second in the pipeline.

### Usage

```js
initiator.run(
  {
    physical_address: "Account/initiator/Datatypes/Number", // This points to a chain
    query: { blocks: 0 }, // Basically saying, index 0 block in physical_address chain, run again its instructions.
    account: `public_key`,
  },
  cb
);
// N.B If query is missing, then VM starts execution from the block-index-0
```

Type `method`

| `Parameters` | Type     | Destructure        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payload`    | object   | `physical_address` | [`Physical Addresses`](https://godprotocol-web.vercel.app/physical_address) are logical namespace locations of tokens. They are derived from the high-level representation of the program's instructions. |
|              | object   | `query`            | A valid blockweb explorer query, you can read the explorer documentation [here](https://godprotocol-web.vercel.app/explorer)                                                                              |
|              | string   | `account`          | Account instance to execute the instructions in.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `cb`         | function |                    | A function that is called with the blocks mined during the execution.                                                                                                                                     |

## Parse Result

The parse is technically the third of the pipeline. It takes like parameters as the `run` method.

### Usage

It is used to retrieve blocks and chains, and also extract their properties.

```js
initiator.parse(
  {
    physical_address: "Account/initiator/Datatypes/Number", // This points to a chain
    query: { blocks: 0 }, // Basically saying, index 0 block in physical_address chain, retrieve it.
    account: `public_key`,
  },
  cb
);
// N.B If query isn't provided, then you parse the chain.
```
